# Fan-Out, Fan-In
This pattern is a combination of two individual patterns, namely **fan-out** and **fan-in**.

## Fan-Out Pattern
Fan-out is a term to describe the process of starting multiple goroutines to handle input from the pipeline

## Fan-In Pattern
Fan-in is a term to describe the process of combining multiple results into one channel

In this way you are distributing the workload and collecting all the results when the work is completed.

You can see through the lines `fi <- even` and `fi <- odd` we are taking two channels and moving their values into
a single channel `fi`.

```go
// receive channel
func receive(e, o chan<- int, fi chan<- int) {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(2)

	go func() {
		for even := range e {
			fi <- even
		}
		wg.Done()
	}()

	go func() {
		for odd := range o {
			fi <- odd
		}
		wg.Done()
	}()

	wg.Wait()
	close(fi)
}
```

This interconnected pattern will take quite some time to get used to.

#### Rob Pike's Example
This is the first time we see the double arrow syntax. You are receiving from the channel and immediately sending it
to another channel.

`c <- <-input1`

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	c := fanIn(boring("Joe"), boring("Ann"))
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		fmt.Println(<-c)
	}
	fmt.Println("You're both boring; I'm leaving.")
}

func boring(msg string) <-chan string {
	c := make(chan string)
	go func() {
		for i := 0; ; i++ {
			c <- fmt.Sprintf("%s %d", msg, i)
			time.Sleep(time.Duration(rand.Intn(1e3)) * time.Millisecond)
		}
	}()
	return c
}

// FAN IN
func fanIn(input1, input2 <-chan string) <-chan string {
	c := make(chan string)
	go func() {
		for {
			c <- <-input1
		}
	}()
	go func() {
		for {
			c <- <-input2
		}
	}()
	return c
}
```
